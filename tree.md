Introduction:

A Tree represents a collection of nodes that are connected in such a way that resembles a tree structure. There is one root node that has a number of child nodes, and each child node has additional child nodes of their own, and so on and so forth. Each node must be connected to exactly one parent node, with the one exception being the root node.

Uses, and why Tree is a useful Data Structure:

Each node within a tree is capable of holding one or more sets of data, such as variables and functions. Due to the way Trees are structured, looping through each node down one descending line is not as practical as it initially sounds. This can, however, be accomplished through recursion, or the practice by which a function can call upon itself multiple times. If done correctly, a recursive function can pull data from the nodes within a Tree as many times as it needs to in order to accomplish its ultimate purpose. Trees can be especially useful for displaying such things as family trees, either with an ascending list of ancestors, or a descending list of descendants.

Big O notation:

If the search is done with a linked list of dynamic array, O(n)

If the search is done on a Binary Search Tree with esclusion of sub-branches, O(log n)
